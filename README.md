## About Me
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 17-year-old aspiring (web developer) who loves to code in JavaScript (Node), TypeScript, CSS (Sass from preprocessor), HTML (Express Pug and ejs templates), PHP (old fashion), and work with MySQL and MongoDB databases. I'm passionate about creating engaging and dynamic web applications. I also have worked with Go and somehow with also C and C++.

**Always Learning**: My brain craves new tech - currently diving into the world of [Angular.js].

**Open to Collaboration**: Let's brew something fantastic together! If you've got an idea, my inbox is always open.ðŸš€
