Coder Extraordinaire: Crafting Web Wonders with Code and Coffee

My brain operates on Javascript, my creativity blooms with HTML and CSS, and my backend logic purrs on PHP and SQL. In short, I'm a web development wizard, brewing digital potions that solve problems and spark delight.

Tech Arsenal:

Front-End: Javascript (with a dash of React), HTML5 (always pushing boundaries), CSS3 (mastering the magic of Sass)
Back-End: PHP (Laravel is my trusty sidekick), SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL, fluent in both)
Tools of the Trade: Git, npm, Composer, VS Code (my code-fueled throne)
Project Playground:

[CSSClassManager: Freely with just two classes for you CSS classes](https://github.com/ermi111/CSSClassManager)
Beyond the Code:

Always Learning: My brain craves new tech like coffee (speaking of, anyone for a refill?) - currently diving into the world of [Angular.js].
Open to Collaboration: Let's brew something fantastic together! If you've got an idea, my inbox is always open.
